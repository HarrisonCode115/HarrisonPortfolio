            <p>Hi, I'm Harrison Ling and I'm an undergraduate computer scientist. I love coding, but as you can tell, I do
                NOT have a knack for design - hence the beautiful invention of Bootstrap.
                I do bits here and there, but my main selling points are great communication and solving problems.

            <h2>Why Hire Me?</h2>
            <!-- If for some reason you're looking at this source code, I know I can put multiple li's in one ul but I liked the way it looked -->
            <p>If you want hear a few reasons to hire me, read below. If not you can always
                shortcut to my CV <a href="Harrison_CV.pdf" download>here</a>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dedication</strong>: If I am presented with a problem that I can get behind, there's going to
                    be very little that will stop me from solving it.
                    I could start with the most basic minimal knowledge and I can make use of my researching skills and
                    background in sciences to teach myself all I need to know.
                    Give me a task, and I'll complete it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Communication</strong>: If there's one thing I value, it's good communication. I love to talk
                    to
                    whoever I can. It's always good to get fresh ideas and hear everyone out. I can voice my
                    own opinions well, but also know when it's time to listen.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assurance</strong>: If I'm given a job to do, not only do I do it, but I'll do it well. When
                    I work on projects, I like to ensure they're made to the best of my ability.
                    I always put 100% into what I do, and like to learn on the fly if needs be to improve.
                </li>

        <div id="about-me" >
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Harrison Ling, I'm an undergrad student at Sheffield University studying Computer Science.
                I've been interested in technology for as long as I can remember. I think a big role in that is modding
                games and making my own little side programs to solve tedious tasks. I really enjoyed electronics in
                secondary school and it sparked a fire that is yet to be extinguished.
                <br><br>Another thing I absolutely love is a good problem. At some point I decided that it was a good
                idea to make a career out of this.
                I like learning new things. I'm always open to try a new approach or adapt to new things.

                <br><br>
                If you'd like to see some of the project I've worked/am working on then please feel free to visit the
                projects page or click <a href="/html/projects.html">here!</a>

        <div id="experience" >
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>As an undergrad, my experience in software mainly comes from working in teams in university projects. These projects all taught me some very fundamental skills: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use the team</strong>: This may seem trivial but when explained it makes much more sense. When you are assigned a team, everyone works in a different way. A skill I've picked up is being able to ensure everyone is included by understanding everyone.
                    What do I mean by this is? Some people work best being told EXACTLY what to do, others like to pick and choose. This is a skill I've always had and find very valuable in all my life and in software engineering.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Leadership</strong>: When I was younger, being a leader never appealed to me.
                     As I grew up and progressed through life, my confidence grew, and I realised that being able to guide people and bring people together was a skill I wasn't aware I had.
                      As I ventured into group projects it seemed I took on an 'unspoken lead'. People would come to me with their issues and ask for assistance.
                       I believe this comes from my approachable and confident manner that allows people to confide in me. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="goals" >
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>A goal of mine has always been to provide something to the world. Something that really makes a difference.
                I believe that my part in that can be best played in the world of Software Engineering.
                 I would love to develop my skills and take my passion to the highest level, producing high quality work and meeting amazing people!
