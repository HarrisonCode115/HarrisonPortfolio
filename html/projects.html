                    Feel free to look at any of the projects, most of them are still being worked on, some more complete

                    These are just ideas that have popped into my head or something I thought would be fun to make while
                    learning something new.

                    <p class="card-text">AI Chat brings multiple popular LLM's together into one place.
                         As we know, different models are good at different things, and sometimes it's quite a pain switching between the different models.
                        On AI Chat, it is a concept that brings this all together, no constant tab changes and new conversations. Simple, quick change. Currently implemented is OpenAI's Chat GPT and Anthropic's Claude. If you want to see the source code please click <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonCode115/OpenAIAPI">here!</a>

                    <p class="card-text">MyneCraft is a game where you can break and place blocks and explore the world.
                         The reason for this game, is to learn and improve on my skills using AI IDEs. In this case I made use of Cursor.
                         In working on this project, I have severely improved my ability to prompt LLMs and provide the correct context to allow it to work at it's best.

                    <p class="card-text">For all you sports fans! Specifically the best sport in the world (controversial I know). Formula tracker is a react based application that I created to learn the basics of react, it's still very much in progress and I'm still learning.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I made this application as I found myself commonly looking up the championship standings throughout the year, and I also was looking at past standings to learn more about the sport. It annoyed me that the Formula 1 App did not have this information to hand.
                        So I decided to solve that problem myself and put it all in one place. It makes use of an API to collect real time data about the current standings. You can view the repository <a href="https://github.com/HarrisonCode115/FormulaTracker">here!</a>

                    <p class="card-text">This is one of my very first projects that I made in Sixth Form. It's made using the p5js library and still is today one of my favourite projects even though it is basic. It's a simple bubble sort algorithm that can be visualized using different height vertical bars.
                        The algorithm slowly (intentionally slowed down for visibility) sorts all the bars in height order. The repository for that is  <a href = "https://github.com/HarrisonCode115/Bubble-Sort-Visualizer">here!</a>
