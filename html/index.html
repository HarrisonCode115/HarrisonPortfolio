            <p>Hi, I'm Harrison Ling and I'm an undergraduate computer scientist. I love coding, but as you can tell, I do
                NOT have a knack for design - hence the beautiful invention of Bootstrap.
                I do bits here and there but my main selling points are great communication and solving problems.

            <h2>Why Hire Me?</h2>
            <!-- If for some reason you're looking at this source code, I know I can put multiple li's in one ul but I liked the way it looked -->
            <p>If you want to listen to me list a few reasons to hire me, read below. If not you can always
                shortcut to my CV <a href="../Harrison_CV.pdf" download>here</a>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dedication</strong>: If I am presented with a problem that I can get behind, there's going to
                    be very little that will stop me from solving it.
                    I could start with the most basic minimal knowledge and I can make use of my researching skills and
                    background in sciences to teach myself all I need to know.
                    Give me a task, and I'll complete it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Communication</strong>: If there's one thing I value, it's good communication. I love to talk
                    to
                    whoever I can. It's always good to get fresh ideas and hear everyone out. I can voice my
                    own opinions well, but also know when it's time to listen.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assurance</strong>: If I'm given a job to do, not only do I do it, but I'll do it well. When
                    I work on projects, I like to ensure they're made to the best of my ability.
                    I always put 100% into what I do, and like to learn on the fly if needs be to improve.
                </li>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Harrison Ling, I'm an undergrad student at Sheffield University studying Computer Science.
                I've been interested in technology for as long as I can remember. I think a big role in that is modding
                games and making my own little side programs to solve tedious tasks. I really enjoyed electronics in
                secondary school and it sparked a fire that is yet to be extinguished.
                <br><br>Another thing I absolutely love is a good problem. At some point I decided that it was a good
                idea to make a career out of this.
                I like learning new things. I'm always open to try a new approach or adapt to new things.

                <br><br>
